    .SYNOPSIS
        This command migrates a project to version 0.3 of the Q# language
        and the Quantum Development Kit.

    .NOTES
        This command replaces the existing Q# source code with new
        source code formatted using 0.3 syntax. The original source code
        is stored in a backup folder under the obj/qsharp folder.

    .PARAMETER Version
        Version of the Quantum Development Kit package to migrate the
        project to.

    .PARAMETER Project
        Path to a C# project file that contains Q# code to be migrated.
        If not set, defaults to migrating C# projects in the current
        directory.

    .PARAMETER Force
        If set, the project will be migrated even if it does not build
        in its current state. This is useful, for instance, when migrating
        a 0.2 project that depends on a project that has already been
        migrated.

    .EXAMPLE
        PS> ./qdk-migrate.ps1

        Migrates a C# project in the current directory to use
        a 0.3-compatible version of the Quantum Development Kit.

    .EXAMPLE
        PS> ./qdk-migrate.ps1 -Force ./src/project-name/ProjectName.csproj

        Migrates the C# project located at `./src/project-name/ProjectName.csproj`
        to a 0.3-compatible version of the Quantum Development Kit,
        even if it does not currently build.
